# Carlos Zanella's Coding Exercise - Turing

This repository contains Carlos Zanella's solutions for the five coding challenges proposed. Each folder from __/01__ to __/05__ contains the solution for one exercise.

Exercises __01__, __02__, __03__ and __05__ were solved using Python. No third-party dependencies were used, so each code can be executed simply by running `python exerciseXX.py`. The version used was __3.10__.

Exercise __04__ was solved using Node.js, as requested. Instructions to test this exercise can be found [in the README.md file for this solution](04/README.md).
